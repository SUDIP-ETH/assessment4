##1 Read in the file, making the gene identifiers the row names. Show a table of values for the first six genes.
imported the .tsv file and set gene identifiers as row names.
##2 Make a new column which is the mean of the other columns. Show a table of values for the first six genes.
computed the average expression value across all samples for each gene.
##3 List the 10 genes with the highest mean expression.
identified the 10 genes with the highest mean expression values.
##4 Determine the number of genes with a mean <10.
counted genes with a mean expression value less than 10
##5 Make a histogram plot of the mean values and include it into your report.
created a histogram showing the distribution of mean gene expression levels.
##6 Import this csv file into an R object. What are the column names?
read the .csv file into R and viewed the column names.
##7 Calculate the mean and standard deviation of tree circumference at the start and end of the study at both sites.
calculated the mean and standard deviation of tree circumference for both years at both sites.
##8 Make a box plot of tree circumference at the start and end of the study at both sites.
produced box plots comparing tree circumference in 2005 vs 2020 for each site.
##9 Calculate the mean growth over the last 10 years at each site.
computed mean increase in circumference (2020 â€“ 2005) at each site.
##10 Use the t.test to estimate the p-value that the 10 year growth is different at the two sites.
applied a two-sample t-test to determine whether the mean growth differed significantly between the two sites.
